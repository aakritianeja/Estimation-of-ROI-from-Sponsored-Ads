# Estimation of ROI from Sponsored Ads

This project aimed at estimating the correct effect of sponsored ads on the revenue by estimating Return on Investment. 
Statistical Analysis, including the difference in difference method has been used for this estimation. 

Sponsored ads were given in Google after a particular week and not given in other websites like Bing, Yahoo, etc. A first difference was done to see the inherent increase in web traffic for Google compared to other websites, then a second difference to see how much the web traffic changed in Google due to the sponsored ads. This correctly estimated the web traffic in Google due to sponsored ads and used it for ROI estimation.
